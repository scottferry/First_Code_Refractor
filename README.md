# Code Refractor Assessment 1

## What Have I Done
This was the first assessment for UWA's Coding Bootcamp. For this assessment, we were 
given code and were required to edit it and make it more 'user friendly' and note
points in code we changed. The site should appear as closely to the screenshot below and
a deployed link showcasing the site below.
